# 🦠  CovidMap-Project

In this project, we aimed to deliver the most up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases and recovery rates worldwide to users. By utilizing technologies such as React, Redux, and Axios, we enabled real-time data updates. We visualized health data in a clear and impactful way, making it easy and fast for users to access critical information.
